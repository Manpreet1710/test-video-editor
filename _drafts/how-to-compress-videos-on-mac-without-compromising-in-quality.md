# **Compress videos on Mac easily**

Congratulations! Your search for “How to compress videos on Mac” has landed you in the perfect place. Here, we will be looking at the various ways in which you can compress your videos on a Mac for free without compromising in quality.

Video compression is an efficient way to save storage and also share files quickly. With advancements in technology, video files tend to become larger and larger in size as most of the content being recorded is now in UHD or higher. Hence, it is always a good practice to compress your video files whenever possible.

**What is video compression?**

Video compression is the process of reducing the total number of bits needed to represent a given image or video sequence. This reduction in the number of bits results in a reduction in the video size.

Compression of files has many benefits and people mostly do it for:

* Reducing the size of unnecessarily long files for faster sharing.
* Reducing the costs of storage hardware.
* Reducing communication bandwidth.

Here, we will be looking at some of the ways to compress video files on a Mac. We will be looking in detail at the various steps involved and will be walking you through different methods so that you can compress your videos easily. So let’s get started without further ado.

**Compressing videos using an Online Compressor**

You can easily compress a video without downloading any third-party applications on your Mac. The online video compressor by **FreeConvert.com** is enough to get the job done within a few clicks.

**About:** Video compressor by FreeConvert.com can be used to compress MP4, AVI, MKV, MOV or any other video file. Default advanced options reduce the video size to 60% of the original. Adjustments can be done to compress even more!

**How to:**

* Click [here](https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor) to open the online compressor.
* Click on **Choose Files** to choose the video that you want to compress. Generally, videos in Mac are in MOV format since this is the video format used by Apple.

* By default, you can only upload files with a maximum size of 1GB. However, you can overcome this limit by upgrading to a paid version.
* Once you have chosen your file, click on **Compress Now!** to carry on with the default settings and initiate the compression process.![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/BTFywPCkHyllMXCX1AjEVFZD6av4kclV0NQUnn4LTTIeoCLu9jqTIWIFNz4mEdO0jF2K-FKur0okWKKdQ7QXKcDJQ0-uo0OKFfWfyBIHTVgnAXUo2jasHphMgVSycZvogZYstXKx =574x142)
* Or, click on the **Settings** button(the little gear icon) to head on to advanced settings.

* Here, you can:
  * **Change the Video Codec:** Video Codec is a technique of compression. You can either choose H264 or H265. H265 codec can reduce video size 20-75% more compared to H264 (especially high-resolution video).
  * **Change the Compression method:** You can choose to compress either by percentage or select a target file size. Options for compressing by lowering video quality, video resolution and bitrate are also available though are not recommended.
  * **Change the target size:** If you choose to compress by percentage, then selecting lower values of percentage will compress more. Smaller values compress more. For example, a 100Mb file would become 25Mb if you select 25%.

If you compress using file size, then just specifying the target file size will get the job done.

* Once you are done with the advanced settings, click on **Compress Now!** to start the compression.
* The time taken for compression will be proportional to the file size and the extent of compression chosen.
* Once the compression is over, click on **Download MOV** to download

your file.
