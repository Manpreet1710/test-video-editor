# Best 15 MOV Compressors to Compress Your MOV Video Effortlessly

Apple created the MOV video format. It is a type of file container that can accommodate a variety of video and multimedia formats. It only works with Apple goods or video players like Quicktime because it was developed by Apple.

MOV files frequently contain video files with high bitrates and little to no compression. They are of excellent quality, however the files are somewhat large.

The technique of lowering the total number of bits required to represent a specific video clip is known as video compression. A program having a specific algorithm or formula for selecting the optimal approach to shrink the size of the data is most typically used to compress video. For example, H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC video compression methods can reduce raw content data by up to 1,000 times.

Video compressors are programs that can shrink the size of video clips. It is a specialized tool for encoding digital data and reducing the total number of the bits occupied it. Popular video file types such as MOV, MOV, FLV, and others are supported by these programs. Many of these apps make it simple to distribute digital information on social media sites.

Video compression software studies each video frame's pixels and reduces their number by combining similar pixels into big chunks. This minimizes the pixel storage space and, as a result, the video size.

Video compression can be divided into two types/methods: Discrete cosine transform (Discrete Cosine Transform) and MC (Motion Compensation).
