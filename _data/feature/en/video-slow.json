      "question": "Will the quality of my videos decrease after editing?",
      "answer": "Slowing down a video online allows you to choose the quality of the video as per your requirement. If you want high-quality video, you can choose a higher resolution, and the file size will be bigger. But if you care about the size of the file and can compromise on the size, then choose a lesser resolution. Slowing down a video online also allows you to choose the CRF value, which means you can choose the resolution and the CRF value as per your need."
