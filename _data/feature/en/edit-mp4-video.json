    {
      "question": "What are the available aspect ratios while cropping?",
      "answer": "MP4 editor allows you to crop your video into multiple aspect ratios i.e.,1:1 (square), 16:9 (landscape), 9:16, 4:3, 3:4(portrait). You can even keep the original ratio of your video and make changes according to your requirement if you don’t want these standard aspect ratios.\nMP4 editor allows you to crop the video as per your need. You only need to drag and adjust the box and move it to the area which you want to keep. MP4 editor makes cropping videos very easy."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will it take to upload my video?",
      "answer": "The time taken to upload your video for cropping or editing depends on the size of your video. Better quality videos with higher resolution will take more time to upload as compared to low quality videos with lesser resolution.\nIt also depends on the type of video you want to edit/crop. The larger the size of the video, the longer it will take."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is CRF value?",
      "answer": "Constant rate factor (CRF) is an encoding mode that adjusts the file data rate up or down to achieve a selected quality level rather than a specific data rate. CRF values range from 0 to 51, with lower numbers delivering higher quality scores."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the quality of my videos decrease after cropping?",
      "answer": "MP4 editor allows you to choose the quality of the video as per your requirement. If you want high quality video, you can choose a higher resolution and the file size will be bigger. But if you care about the size of the file and can compromise in the size then chose a lesser resolution.\nMP4 editor also allows you to choose the CRF value, which means you can choose the resolution and the CRF value as per your need.\nCRF values lie from 0-1, where a lower CRF provides better compression and quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the resolutions available and what will be the size of the file of different resolutions?",
      "answer": "MP4 editor provides all the standard resolutions i.e., 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, and 240p. Keep in mind that a higher resolution file size will be more than a file with lower resolution. The size of the file will also depend on the length of the video, the resolution, the aspect ratio and the CRF values."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are encoding speeds?",

You can shorten your video as much as you like from either the starting or the ending or both as well.\nSplitting a video, means dividing your video into two or more parts. After splitting you video you can make individual changes to video parts and save the video as one file."
