    {
      "question": "How can I rotate multiple videos?",

After the video has been processed, you can see the download option on the screen. By clicking on it you can download the rotated file. In order to rotate another video, you only need to refresh the browser and you will see the upload Video option. Now you can again select your file which you want to rotate."
