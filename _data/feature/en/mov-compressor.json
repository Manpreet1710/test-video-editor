    {
      "question": "Can I compress my videos using MOV Compressor?",
      "answer": "MOV Compressor allows you to compress MOV video files. For other file formats like MP4, you can choose our MP4 Compressor. You only have to upload your video, select the encoding speed and CRF value and click on save.  You file will be compressed as per your desired size."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long will it take to upload my video?",
      "answer": "The time taken to upload your video for cropping or editing depends on the size of your video. Better quality videos with higher resolution will take more time to upload as compared to low quality videos with lesser resolution.\nIt also depends on the type of video you want to compress. The larger the size of the video, the longer it will take.\n"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is CRF value?",
      "answer": "Constant rate factor (CRF) is an encoding mode that adjusts the file data rate up or down to achieve a selected quality level rather than a specific data rate. CRF values range from 0 to 51, with lower numbers delivering higher quality scores."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the quality of my videos decrease after compressing?",
      "answer": "When you compress a file, the file size will be reduced and to do that, the quality has to be compromised. To make sure that you do not lose out the quality, MOV Compressor allows you to choose the quality of the video as per your requirement. If you want high quality video, you can choose a higher resolution and the file size will be bigger. But if you care about the size of the file and can compromise in the size then chose a lesser resolution.\nMOV Compressor also allows you to choose the CRF value, which means you can choose the resolution and the CRF value as per your need.\nCRF values lie from 0-1, where a lower CRF provides better compression and quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the resolutions available and what will be the size of the file of different resolutions?",
      "answer": "MOV Compressor provides all the standard resolutions i.e., 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, and 240p. Keep in mind that a higher resolution file size will be more than a file with lower resolution. The size of the file will also depend on the length of the video, the resolution, the aspect ratio and the CRF values."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are encoding speeds?",
      "answer": "MOV Compressor allows you to choose encoding speed i.e., the speed at which you want to convert the video and save it for download.
