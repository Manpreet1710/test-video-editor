Similar to how you would download a video from Twitter, you may download a video from Facebook by copying the share link and pasting it into a third-party website that will handle everything for you.

**Download for mobile devices**

FDown.net is excellent on both iOS and Android mobile smartphones. The catch is that it doesn't function with iOS's Safari browser. The creators claim that using Chrome doesn't improve things much either. FDown.net advises using Firefox for mobile (opens in a new window). You might not be aware that the films are private until the final step, but they won't work on private or non-public ones.

Facebook video search (in any browser If the video is a Reels one, you can probably acquire a copy link by clicking the ellipsis. Otherwise, select the "Share It" option. Look for the Copy Link option on the Share screen. Firefox should be opened, FDOWN.net loaded, the URL pasted, and the download selected.

**Direct Desktop Download**

Nearly every video on Facebook has a "Save Video" item in the ellipsis menu. However, that just "saves" the movie on Facebook to a part of your account called "Saved Videos," where you can organize collections to view later. It does not save the video to your local storage. You won't have access to the video if the owner deletes it.

You may watch it by forwarding the shortened link (beginning with [https://fb.watch/](https://fb.watch/ "https://fb.watch/")(Opens in a new window)) to something that begins with [https://www.facebook.com/watch/](https://www.facebook.com/watch/ "https://www.facebook.com/watch/") by pasting that into a new browser tab (Opens in a new window). Enter "mbasic" in place of "www" in the address bar.

This compels the browser to load the page's mobile version for you. Open the link in a new tab by choosing the right-click menu next to the video. You will only view the movie in this new third tab, so you may save it to your computer by right-clicking once more and choosing Save video.

The drawback of this approach is that the video you receive isn't exceptionally high-res. However, there is a quicker method to download a better Facebook video.
