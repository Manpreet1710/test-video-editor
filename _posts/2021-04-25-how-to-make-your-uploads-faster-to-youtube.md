# **How to upload YouTube videos faster**

YouTube is no doubt the most popular streaming platform. With over 2.3 billion users worldwide, YouTube has managed to keep its audience captivated by providing the freedom to upload various genres of content and making it readily accessible with just a few clicks and taps.

If you are a YouTuber or someone who is recently experimenting with YouTube and are looking for ways to upload videos to YouTube faster, then you have come to the right place.

In this article, we will look at the various issues that cause slow uploads to YouTube and then we will provide solutions to them for a faster upload. So let’s get started without further ado.

_Reasons for slow uploads:_

**The difference in frame rates between exported and recorded videos:** If you exported your video in a higher frame rate(say 60fps) than the frame rate in which you recorded it(say 30fps) then it will just make the uploads drastically longer without even increasing the quality since it will be uselessly playing a frame twice instead of once. Hence, always make sure that your content should be encoded and uploaded in the same frame rate it was recorded.

**Using your internet for various other tasks while uploading:** Uploads in YouTube are designed to take the full potential of your upload speeds. The upload speeds are affected if you are using your internet at various other places such as streaming, downloading, rendering, etc. Hence, avoid using your internet at other places while the video is uploading.

**Slow internet connection:** It is quite obvious that a slow internet connection will result in slow uploads. If you are using a wireless connection(WiFi), it is recommended to switch to a wired connection. For this, connect an ethernet cable from your computer to a free LAN port on your modem or router. This will ensure the fastest speed available.

**Not using an appropriate browser:** If you are using an old version of your browser, consider updating to the latest version. This will ensure fast packet transfers thus resulting in faster uploads. YouTube recommends using the latest version of Google Chrome, or Firefox browsers when uploading videos since these browsers are optimized to handle YouTube uploads.

So these were some general issues with quite simple solutions that might be the cause for slow uploads. Working on them are surely guaranteed to make your uploads at least faster than before. Coming to more specific solutions that will surely improve your upload speeds are:

# **_Uploading your videos faster using MP4 format_**

YouTube recommends the container of the video to be an MP4 instead of other video formats such as MOV, AVI, or WMV. Sticking to this guideline will ensure faster uploads to YouTube.

**How to convert your videos to MP4:**

* Click [here](https://cloudconvert.com/mp4-converter) to open the free online converter by CloudConvert.
* Click on **Select File**.

* Your video file will now be uploaded for conversion. The time taken for upload and conversion will be proportional to the size of your video file.
* Once the conversion is done, click on the green **Download** button to download your MP4.

# **_Uploading your videos faster by changing video and audio codecs_**

YouTube recommends using an **H.264** codec for your videos and an **AAC-LC** codec for your audio.

But, what is a codec?

_Codecs are compression technologies and have two components, an encoder to compress the files, and a decoder to decompress._

**_H.264_** _is one such codec and is best suited for video compressions._

We can use any video editor available in the market to change the codec of our video and compress it. We can also optimize it further by changing the audio sample rate, deinterlacing and many more thus ensuring faster uploads. Here, we will be using free software called **HandBrake** to optimize our videos for YouTube.

**About:** HandBrake is a tool for converting video from nearly any format to a selection of modern, widely supported codecs. Not only can it convert and compress videos to any format, but it is also free and open-source. It is available on multiple platforms such as Windows, Mac and Linux.
