When you record a video using the Instagram app, it is stored there rather than being downloaded to your phone.

You must manually save the movie to your camera roll if you want it to be backed up on your iPhone or Android.

However, bear in mind that storing films to your phone means they'll take up space on your device before you start backing up all of your Instagram videos.

For instance, if you're short on space, you might want to migrate certain items to the cloud or use another backup strategy to preserve your data while freeing up space before continuing.

**Ways to save Instagram videos added to your story**

To save any Instagram story video you've posted to your phone, follow these steps:

1. Open Instagram.
2. Click the bubble that says "Stories" in the top-left portion of the screen.
3. The "Your Story" bubble in your Stories should be touched.
4. Choose either "Save" or "Save Video" from the pop-up menu (iOS users will be given the option to save the entire story).
5. You should receive a prompt confirmation that your video has been saved to your device's camera roll after completing the procedure.

On an Android smartphone, users must launch File Manager, select the data option, and then choose com.instagram.android. The user may locate all the videos they've seen on their smartphone under the cache option, which is where the video can be found.
