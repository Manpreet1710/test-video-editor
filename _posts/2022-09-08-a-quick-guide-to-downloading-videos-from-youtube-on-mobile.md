On smartphones, downloaded YouTube videos have a 30-day expiration date but are not removed from the Downloads folder.

How to use the app Tubemate to download YouTube videos to your Android phone's gallery

Although this was addressed in a separate post, we'll briefly go over how to download YouTube videos on an Android phone here as well for your convenience. Users of Android phones can download YouTube videos via a third-party app called TubeMate in addition to the browser option. The Google Play Store and Apple App Store don't have the app. However, TubeMate may still be side-loaded into Android devices via an APK file.

iPhone users cannot access the feature since iOS prevents users from side-loading third-party apps. The following are the methods for using Tubemate to download YouTube videos onto an Android mobile device:

Install the TubeMate APK on your Android phone by downloading it from the official website.

You must turn on the "Install unknown apps" setting in Settings before you can complete the installation.

Open the app, accept the "Terms of Use," provide the necessary permissions, and then click "Home" to return to the app's main screen.

You'll receive brief instruction on using TubeMate.

Once you've finished, look for and launch the video you want to download.

In the bottom right corner, click the red "download" button with a downward pointing arrow. By doing so, a window where you may select the video resolution will open. To download the video, choose the resolution and then press the Download option (again, a red downward-pointing icon).

Download and install MP3 Video Converter from the Google Play Store if a notification stating that "Sometimes '*' marked videos might not be available" is flashing on your screen.

After that, you'll be able to download any YouTube video, whether it's public or private, to your smartphone.

Tap the downward-pointing arrow symbol in the bottom tray to manage your downloads library. You may view the list of YouTube videos that have been downloaded to your mobile device and the status of your downloads on the screen that follows.

### **Download Videos for Free**

With the exception of YouTube, which forbids extension-based downloads, Free Video Downloader is a Chrome extension that works on almost all video sites.

Along with many other file types, the Free Video Downloader supports MP4, MOV, FLV, AVI, WEBM, ASF, and MPG.

The extension works with 99%+ of websites that host videos and allows for simultaneous download of several videos. Free Video Downloader allows video playlists in addition to video downloads.

### **FastestTube YouTube Downloading Software**

Because they aren't supported in the Chrome Store, FastestTube and YouTube Video Downloader both require a little more installation time and skill than the aforementioned extensions.

You'll need to manually install these extensions because YouTube makes it exceedingly difficult to get videos from the website.

Fortunately, it's not challenging, and the website itself offers detailed instructions.

FastestTube supports Mac and Linux and functions with Chrome or any other Chromium-based browser.

Firefox, Chrome, and Linux all support YouTube Video Downloader (sorry Mac). FastestTube and YouTube Video Downloader are both reliable ways to download YouTube videos, while YouTube Video Downloader has additional features.

## **FAQs**
