# **Various ways to change the aspect ratio of videos**

The presentation of a video plays an important role in capturing the attention of the audience. Be it for video marketing or some other general-purpose work, we want our videos to appear the best version of themselves in the eyes of our audience. This requires some minor and major tweaks and modifications in the specs of the videos. Aspect ratio is one such spec which is undoubtedly the most important one.

**What is Aspect Ratio?**

In layman terms, an aspect ratio defines a relationship between the dimensions of an entity. In our case, the aspect ratio turns out to be the ratio between the width and height of a video.

Aspect ratio plays an important role in defining the shape of the video. Naturally, changing the width and height of the video will result in changes in shape. Therefore, we optimize the aspect ratio of our videos so that they look the same across different platforms. For example, the aspect ratio for Instagram video’s is 1:1. The same for YouTube is 16:9. Now imagine playing a 1:1 video made for Instagram on a 16:9 player of YouTube. Looks odd, doesn’t it?

Don’t worry, we have got you covered. Here, we will be looking at the easiest of ways to change the aspect ratio of a video. At the end of this article, we will also be providing a list of the most used aspect ratios and where to use them. So let’s get started without further ado.

# **_A guide to most commonly used aspect ratios:_**

If you want your video to be optimized according to some particular platform such as _Instagram_ or _TikTok_ but don’t know which aspect ratio to go for, then this might help you.

The list of commonly used aspect ratios are:

* **16:9 ratio**: The 16:9 aspect ratio is a standard format for High Definition Television. Under this format, the video appears on a widescreen which is apt for watching movies and gives the user a cinematic experience. This aspect ratio is used primarily by YouTube. It is also popular on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.
* **1:1 ratio**: While the 16:9 aspect ratio gives the shape of a wide rectangle, the 1:1 aspect ratio gives the shape of a square. Therefore, it is also known as the ‘Square Format’. It is mostly used in Instagram feeds.
* **9:16 ratio**: The 9:16 ratio is the opposite of the 16:9 ratio. Although both of them are rectangle in shape, the 16:9 ratio is a horizontally wide rectangle whereas the 9:16 is a vertically high rectangle. The 9:16 ratio is used at many places such as Instagram Stories, Instagram IGTV videos, Snapchat, TikTok and many more.
* **4:5 ratio**: The 4:5 ratio is a rectangle that is almost a square since the ratio between width and height is 4:5. It is mostly used by Facebook in its socials.
* **2:3 ratio**: Pinterest mostly uses 2:3 vertical rectangle videos.

So these were some of the many ways of changing the aspect ratio of your video across various operating systems. Hope you give them a try.
