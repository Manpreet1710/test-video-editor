“How to add GIFs to videos?”. If this question popped into your mind, then welcome, you are in the right place.

GIFs, although often confused as short video clips, are a series of moving images. One may think of it like a flipbook where the still images are played at a fast speed one after the other to create a moving animation.

Fun fact: GIFs were voted as 2019’s most popular visual formats on the web with the most viewed GIF having over 419 million views.

Adding a GIF to your video ensures that you are engaging efficiently with your audience. People add GIFs to their videos primarily because:

* GIFs speak the language of the internet: If there is something viral breaking the internet, there’s a 100% chance that you can find a GIF on it. Since they are so popular among netizens, adding them to your videos allows the viewers to relate to something they love.
* It adds an informal user-friendly touch to the video: When the viewer finds a funny GIF in your video, they will connect more to your video as it would help in capturing their attention.
