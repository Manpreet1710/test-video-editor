# **Compress videos on Mac easily**

Congratulations! Your search for “How to compress videos on Mac” has landed you in the perfect place. Here, we will be looking at the various ways in which you can compress your videos on a Mac for free without compromising in quality.

Video compression is an efficient way to save storage and also share files quickly. With advancements in technology, video files tend to become larger and larger in size as most of the content being recorded is now in UHD or higher. Hence, it is always a good practice to compress your video files whenever possible.

**What is video compression?**

Video compression is the process of reducing the total number of bits needed to represent a given image or video sequence. This reduction in the number of bits results in a reduction in the video size.

Compression of files has many benefits and people mostly do it for:

* Reducing the size of unnecessarily long files for faster sharing.
* Reducing the costs of storage hardware.
* Reducing communication bandwidth.

Here, we will be looking at some of the ways to compress video files on a Mac. We will be looking in detail at the various steps involved and will be walking you through different methods so that you can compress your videos easily. So let’s get started without further ado.

# **_Compressing videos using an Online Compressor_**

  * **Change the Video Codec:** Video Codec is a technique of compression. You can either choose H264 or H265. H265 codec can reduce video size 20-75% more compared to H264 (especially high-resolution video).
  * **Change the Compression method:** You can choose to compress either by percentage or select a target file size. Options for compressing by lowering video quality, video resolution and bitrate are also available though are not recommended.
  * **Change the target size:** If you choose to compress by percentage, then selecting lower values of percentage will compress more. Smaller values compress more. For example, a 100Mb file would become 25Mb if you select 25%.

If you compress using file size, then just specifying the target file size will get the job done.
